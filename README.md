# Professional README Generator

## Description
---


When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. This is often the first thing that other developers, users and potential employers will see when visiting your GitHub or viewing a project, so it's important that you provide a clear and concise description of what it is you're making and how to use it.

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.
